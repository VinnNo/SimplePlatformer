As a huge fan of the 64, I wanted to get some handles on how to implement some of the gameplay features from Mario 64 and Legend of Zelda.

So far, I haven't mode a whole lot of progress, as this is a low-priority, side project BUT here's what we're looking at:

- Relative to camera movement
- Camera rotation and reset rotation controls (includes mobile swipe gestures)
- Mario 64 style triple jump
- Jump percision variance, to compensate for delayed human reaction
- Item collect cinematics
- HUD with some action prompts
- Chests that launch items
- Doors with locks
- Keys
- Prompts
- Cinematic item collection sequence
