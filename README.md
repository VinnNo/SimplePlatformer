# Nostalgia and Curiosity
As a huge fan of the Nintendo 64 and some of its most popular titles, I wanted to get some handles on how to implement some of the gameplay features from Mario 64 and Legend of Zelda that made them feel soooo good. My goal is to recreate these amazing features and pack them into a simple control-scheme as to be easy to add intuitive touch-screen controls.. For some reason.

So far, I haven't made a whole lot of progress, as this is a low-priority, side project BUT here's the features we're looking at:

- Relative to camera movement
- Camera rotation and reset rotation controls
- Mario 64 style triple-jump
- Jump percision variance, to compensate for delayed human reaction
- Item collect cinematics
- HUD with some action prompts
- Chests that launch items
- Doors with locks
- Keys
- Prompts
- Cinematic item collection sequence
- VERY basic attacks, hardly worth mentioning
- Simple, code-driven squash/stretch procedural animation for jumping/landing
- Mobile friendly controls and gestures

I did not make any of the assets, BUT I made the extra animations for the Fox character, which would be my first time animating in 3D. So! If you see that the animations are flawed (and they are), that'd be why! There is also some code to drive a simple squash/stretch procedural animation when jumping/landing

## Player's TO-DO
- The equipment and by extension, the attack system has recieved almost no attention just yet. So, I'll need to get some place-holder items in place to better work out the equiping and unequiping system
- Locked chests
- Example doors that require different keys
- Box grab / push system and states
- Pickup / throw items (animations are already done for this)
- Heart-based health system (Currently, it's just a mockup)
- Refactor, cleanup and documentation


&nbsp; 
- ### Combat
- Zelda-eque target locking, target locked behaviours and movements, 3-swing combo system and a power attack
- Functional shield-block
